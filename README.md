Here, a fragment of this topic is brought to life - Pseudo Code and Flow Chart.
While Pseudo code is not a programming language, 
it is a simpler version of a programming code in plain English before it is implemented in any programming language.
Remember, there are "no one does it all" rule when it comes to a Pseudocode.
The simpler-the better.

Some Key Points to note while writing a Pseudo code includes;

A. Capitalize key command

B. Use Identation.

C. Code itself is hard enough, keep it simple.

D. Be Specific

E. Be concise


Attached herein are two examples of Pseudocodes in flow chat to explain the below:

Example 1: PseudoCode to calculate Sum of Squares of any Given Number N
Read n
For n = natural numbers

If n%2==0
write "Sum of squares of first even numbers is"	
[2n(n + 1)(2n + 1)] / 3

If If n%2==1
write "Sum of squares of first n odd numbers is"	
[n(2n+1)(2n-1)] / 3

If n = n1 + n2
write "Sum of Squares of Two Natural Numbers is"
(n1)2 + (n2)2 = (n1 + n2)2 - 2n1*n2

Addition of two natural numbersIf n = n1 + n2 + n3
Sum of Squares of Three Natural Numbers
(n1)2 + (n2)2 + (n3)2 = (n1 + n2 + n3)2 - 2n1*n2 -2n2*n3 -2n3*n1

Else 
write "Sum of squares of n natural numbers is"
[n(n+1)(2n+1)] / 6


Example 2: PseudoCode to  calculate a running sum. A user will enter numbers that will be added to the
sum and when a negative number is encountered, stop adding numbers and write out the final result.

Read n

Set sum to 0;

While(n >= 0)

Set sum to n + sum
 
Read n
